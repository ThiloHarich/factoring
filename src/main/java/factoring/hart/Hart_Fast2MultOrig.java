/**
 * Pretty simple yet fast variant of Hart's one line factorizer.
 * This implementations introduces some improvements that make it the fastest factoring algorithm
 * for numbers with more then 20? and less then 50 bit.
 * It avoids the complexity of calculating the square root when factoring multiple numbers,
 * by storing the square roots of k in the main loop. This has the highest performance impact.
 *
 * But there are some other improvements:
 *
 * It uses an optimized trial division algorithm to factorize small numbers.
 *
 * After calculating a number 'a' above sqrt(4*m*k) a will be adjusted to satisfy
 * some modulus a power of 2 argument.
 * It reuses the idea of rounding up by adding a well chosen constant (Warren D. Smith)
 *
 * We choose k to be a multiple of 315 = 3*3*5*7 and 45 = 3*3*5 this causes that
 * a^2 - 4kn = b^2 mod 3*3*5*7 or 3*3*5 which increases the chance to find a solution a^2 - 4kn = b^2 pretty much.
 * We iterate over k1 = 315 * i and k2 = 45 * i in parallel, but make sure that k2 != k1.
 *
 * General idea of this implementation:
 *
 * It tires to find solutions for a^2 - 4*m*i*n = b^2 from fermat we then know that
 * gcd(a+b, n) and gcd(a-b, n) are divisors of n.
 *
 * This is done by one simple loop over k were we generate numbers a = sqrt(4*m*k*n).
 * By storing sqrt(k) in an array this can be calculated fast.
 *
 * Compared with the regular Lehman algorithm, the Hart algorithm does not
 * need a second loop to iterate over the numbers 'a' for a given 'k' in the equation a^2 - 4kn.
 * This means that the upper bound for this loop - which would be a expensive sqrt call - does not has to be calculated.
 *
 * For each k the value sqrt(k) in order to determine a = ceil(sqrt(4kn))
 * the sqrt will be calculated only once and then stored in an array. This speeds up the sieving buy
 * a big factor since calculating the sqrt is expensive.
 *
 *
 * For any kind of test numbers except very hard semiprimes, Hart_TDiv_Race will be faster.
